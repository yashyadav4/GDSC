        GDSC IET DAVV is a part of dynamic community where students from various
        backgrounds come together to explore the latest in technology, learn
        about Google's tools and platforms, and collaborate on innovative
        projects. GDSC is a place to grow as a developer, starting from a
        beginner developer to an advanced developer. It's not always about
        “programming” but also about connecting, learning together and growing
        together
